This directory includes primitives for on-chain confidential financial systems:

- {VestingWalletConfidential}: Handles the vesting of confidential tokens for a given beneficiary. Custody of multiple tokens can be given to this contract, which will release the token to the beneficiary following a given, customizable, vesting schedule.
- {VestingWalletCliffConfidential}: Variant of {VestingWalletConfidential} which adds a cliff period to the vesting schedule.
- {VestingWalletExecutorConfidential}: Extension of {VestingWalletConfidential} that adds an executor role able to perform arbitrary calls on behalf of the vesting wallet (e.g. to vote, stake, or perform other management operations).
